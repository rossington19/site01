			Linked Lights is the first app developed by Peatti Designs. It is a simple puzzle game where players must turn on all of the lights by pressing on them which toggles itself and the linked lights. Game modes include a "Time Out", where players race against the clock; "Perfection", which requires the puzzle to be solved in five or fewer moves, and "Hidden", which hides the links associated with each button.
